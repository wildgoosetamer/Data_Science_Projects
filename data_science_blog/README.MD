# Write a Data Science Blog (Udacity_Project_1)

## Description
In this project, I have investigated why certain Airbnb listings are more successful than others. This analysis focussed on Airbnb listings in Boston and Seattle. Estimated revenues of listings will also be used to define the success of a listing. The primary questions that have been answered upon completion of this project are:

1. How much revenue do Airbnb hosts make?
2. What are the best types of property to rent?
3. When is the best time to rent?
4. Which are the best areas to rent?
5. What should you write in a listing name to attract more attention?

In addition, several models (Linear Models, XGBoost) were trained to predict the estimated revenues of listings. The results of the models will be used to explore which are the most important factors in achieving higher revenues.

The article detailing the key findings of this project can be found [here].

## Installations
Anaconda, Seaborn, Nltk, Re, WordCloud, XGBoost, Shap, Bokeh

To run the section of the code involving Bokeh, there is a need to get a Geocoding API from google [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key)
